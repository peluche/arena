        "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a cutting-edge reinforcement learning algorithm that has gained significant attention in recent years. As an improvement over traditional policy optimization methods, PPO addresses key challenges such as sample efficiency, stability, and robustness in training deep neural networks for reinforcement learning tasks. With its ability to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, PPO has demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of complex environments, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous control systems.\n",

        "In this section, you'll build your own agent to perform PPO on the CartPole environment. By the end, you should be able to train your agent to near perfect performance in about 30 seconds. You'll also be able to try out other things like **reward shaping**, to make it easier for your agent to learn to balance, or to do fun tricks! There are also additional exercises which allow you to experiment with other tasks, including **Atari** and the 3D physics engine **MuJoCo**.\n",

When calling `next_obs = envs.reset()`, next_obs gets a batch of $N$ initial observations (pronounced \"next observation\"). PPO also initializes an environment `done` flag variable next_done (pronounced \"next done\") to an $N$-length array of zeros, where its i-th element `next_done[i]` has values of 0 or 1 which corresponds to the $i$-th sub-environment being *not done* and *done*, respectively.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Make sure the things you're adding to memory are the right shape (otherwise the `add` method will throw an error). This includes paying attention to the batch dimension when you put things through the actor and critic networks.\n",
        "    * The memory expects everything to have shape `(num_envs,)` except for observations which have shape `(num_envs, 4)`.\n",
        "* Don't forget to use inference mode when running your actor and critic networks, since you're only generating data $\\theta_\\text{old}$ (i.e. you don't want to update the weights of the network based on these values).\n",
        "* Don't forget to increment the step count `self.step` by the number of environments (you're stepping once for each env!) in each call to `play_step`.\n",
        "* At the end of `play_step`, you should update `self.next_obs` and `self.next_done` (because this is where our agent will start next time `play_step` is called).\n",
        "    * For more on why we need these values, see [this section](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/#:~:text=role%20to%20help%20transition%20between%20phases) of detail #1 in the \"37 implementational details\" post.\n",

        "</details>\n",
        "\n",
        "For this exercise and others to follow, there's a trade-off in the test functions between being strict and being lax. Too lax and the tests will let failures pass; too strict and they might fail for odd reasons even if your code is mostly correct. If you find youself continually failing tests (or passing tests despite not matching the solutions exactly, and running into confusing errors later!) then you should ask a TA for help.\n",

        "Two final notes on this implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "* We've chosen `PPOAgent` to subclass `nn.Module`. This is so so that we can call `agent.parameters()` to get the parameters of the actor and critic networks, and feed these params into our optimizer.\n",
        "* We've given you a `get_minibatches` method, which is useful because the earlier `get_minibatches` function required the next observation & value, and these are either stored or easily computable by our agent. You should be using this method rather than the original `get_minibatches` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decisions like these aren't super important in the grand scheme of things, although they're important to keep track of, because they can often be the difference between a buggy and working RL implementation."

For example, training an agent to play Wordle (or a relation like Semantle) might be a suitably difficult task. [This post](https://wandb.ai/andrewkho/wordle-solver/reports/Solving-Wordle-with-Reinforcement-Learning--VmlldzoxNTUzOTc4) gives a high level account of training an agent to play Wordle - they use DQN, but they don't go too deep into the technical details (and it's possible that PPO would work better for this task)."
